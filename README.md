# Cervical-Cancer-Cell-Detection-
Project : Cervical Cancer Cell Detection using Image Processing and MATLAB


# INTRODUCTION 

Cervical cancer growth in women is a standout amongst the most widely recognized tumors around the world, next just to bosom disease. Moderately aged ladies between the ages of 40-55 years are for the most part influenced by this malignancy. Consistently cervical is analyzed in around 500,000 ladies comprehensively and is in charge of in excess of 280,000 deaths yearly. These days there is a wide variety in the quantity of cervical malignancy cases over the globe. Hazard factors incorporate smoking, unprotected sex or having HIV disease, delayed utilization of anti-conception medication pills. In the western side, pervasiveness of this illness is steadily diminishing a result of the early identification through customary screening. 80% of the new cervical malignant growth cases happen in creating nations, similar to India, which reports around 1/4th of the world's instances of cervical disease every year. 

# Objectives 
Following are the objectives which are monitored and accomplished in this work: 
1)	To develop an automated system that enable proficient and effective detection of Cervical Cancer that can be implemented for commercial purpose. 
2)	Making use of image processing toolboxes of MATLAB 
3)	Pathologists can use this method as a decision support in detecting cancer. This will reduce the workload on clinicians and makes the diagnosis of cancer faster, economical and more accurate.
